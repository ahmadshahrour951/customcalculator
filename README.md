Language: Python 3.7.6
Description: A simple calculator that converts a Fahrenheit temperature to a Celsius temperature and vice versa. Once you run the program, it will prompt you for two questions. The first will be asking which unit of temperature would you like to enter and the second is the numeric temperature you want to enter. Finally, once your input is correct and entered (otherwise the program will keep asking) the answer will be displayed.
